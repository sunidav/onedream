# Learn Stable Diffusion

This is a personal project to learn and experiment with **Stable Diffusion**, an AI model for text-to-image generation.

## Goals

- Understand how Stable Diffusion works
- Run it locally and/or using online services (like Hugging Face, Google Colab)
- Generate images from prompts
- Fine-tune or experiment with custom models (optional)

## Tools

- Python
- Hugging Face `diffusers` library
- Google Colab or local GPU setup
- Stable Diffusion weights/models

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn-stable-diffusion.git
cd learn-stable-diffusion
